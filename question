Part 1: Nagios Monitoring Setup with CentOS Server and Fedora Client/s
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Setup up Nagios (Latest Version), a powerful monitoring system, within a CentOS
server-Fedora client architecture. Install and configure Nagios Core on the CentOS
server which should be the central monitoring server.
2. Configure the Nagios server by defining host and services for the Fedora client/s to be
monitored, configuring host checks to verify the availability of Fedora clients using
ping and configuring service checks to monitor critical services such as HTTP, SSH,
and disk usage on Fedora client/s.
3. Implement checks for CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network connectivity,
and any other relevant metrics on Fedora client/s.


Part 2: DNS Caching Setup with CentOS Server and Fedora Clients
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Set Up CentOS Server as a DNS Caching Server
2. Configure Fedora client machines to use the DNS caching server set up on the CentOS
server for DNS resolution, ensuring faster and more efficient DNS lookups for network traffic.
3. Perform DNS resolution tests on Fedora clients to verify that they are correctly utilizing the DNS caching server.
